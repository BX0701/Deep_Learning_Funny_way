# Deep_Learning_Funny_way
Learn Deep Learning by simple way, hooray!!!

**Purpose**: To document my self-learning journey and to share my knowledge with those in need of understanding. May everyone gain valuable insights, and please do not hesitate to provide feedback if you notice any inaccuracies. Thank you, everyone! 

**Method**: My learning approach involves establishing connections between different pieces of knowledge, and to some extent, I rely on the "5W1H" method that I learned from my peers.

**Usage**: Within each topic, there will be multiple issues for discussion, and I have divided them into individual subfolders.
